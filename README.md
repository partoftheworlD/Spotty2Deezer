### Just a simple project which allows you to import your spotify's playlist to Deezer

The main reason for writing this script is paid alternatives for such simple functionality.
Probably won't be supported, as I've moved all my playlists and script is no longer needed. 
About improvements, I would add multi-threading and need to make a normal search not a simple query, but with an author and track name, something like this (?q=author: 69 track: nice)
